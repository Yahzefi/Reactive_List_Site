# Project Description

A television watchlist application built using the Angular Framework (HTML, CSS, TypeScript)

## Overview

It allows users to add, remove, and search/filter though television shows on their watchlist.  It accomplishes this by using a local JSON file as a mock database and by utilizing local storage to maintain user's client-side information.  The JSON data is fetched in the same way as when fetching an external API's data (service files / observables).

## The Process

I started this application in early January 2021 and completed it around the end of the same month.  It served as my introduction to frameworks as a whole, which meant I encountered a lot of firsts throughout the experience.  It was my first time thinking of certain pieces of the site as "components" and organizing the code in a uniform fashion in order for it to even function properly.  There was a lot thrown at me all at once, including the additional learning curve of using TypeScript.  At this point I'd only used JavaScript, and so the idea of type casting was an entirely new world to me.  After some time, though, I actually began to enjoy using TypeScript as it allowed for quite a bit more specificity.  It was also an introduction to using the Command Line and in order to complete it I had to learn some basic node packages as well as using "ng" to access the Angular CLI.

## Final Remarks

As I look back over my watchlist application, I immediately noticed many stylization decisions which pain me to see.  Like I said in the prior section, this was the first time I used TypeScript so I'm not too surprised it's a little messy; however, I still think it holds up relatively well.  That being said, I still think it could be better with some adjustments.  I see this as a good thing, though, as it shows I've improved more and more with each project I complete.  It's awesome to look at some of my past work and realize how much I've improved since then, and inspires me to work that much harder to surprise myself even more when I look at the projects I'm currently coding a few months from now.
